Description
-----------

Microinteractions are those little moments where design and code work together at their best. When used with care, they can even become signature moments, the way clapping for an article on Medium expresses the brand’s identity in a way that goes beyond any language or culture. In this talk, I’ll introduce the microinteraction at the abstract level, reveal its building blocks and show some concrete ways to understand and use them to create memorable, compelling interfaces.

Extra Information
-----------------

Microinteractions are my hobby. As a Frontend tech lead I love finding interesting microineractions, reverse-engineer them. Read and research the field as well as write and talk about them and their importance to create outstanding user experiences. I further aspire to empower Frontend developers to become more aware of microinteractions and help them step up to implement and sometimes even design microinteractions in the products they build from day to day.
